# PC Setup

Download the latest version of the .NET framework for your system from here;

https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0

# Remote Deployment and Debugging

If you'd like to be able to write code on your PC and then Deploy and Debug that code directly on a Raspberry Pi, then I've create a one line script to set that up;

```
curl --output remotedebugsetup.bat https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pjgpetecodes/dotnet6pi/master/remotedebugsetup.bat && remotedebugsetup.bat
```

# Setup PC for Remote Deployment and Debugging an Uno Application

If you'd like to be able to Create an Uno Platform Application on your PC and then Deploy and Debug that code directly on a Raspberry Pi, then I've create a one line script to set that up;

```
curl --output remotedebugsetup_uno.bat https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pjgpetecodes/dotnet6pi/master/remotedebugsetup_uno.bat && remotedebugsetup_uno.bat
```

# IoT Hub Connection

The 3 IoT Hub Based Examples will require an IoT Hub Device Primary Connection String to work. 

# Deploying from VS Code on Windows

If you want to Deploy from VSCode on a Windows PC, then modify the RaspberryDeployWSL task's ```rsync``` command in the ```.vscode/tasks.json``` files in the various projects to point to your Pi IP Address;

```
"'sshpass -p \"raspberry\" rsync -rvuz $(wslpath '\"'${workspaceFolder}'\"')/bin/linux-arm/publish/ pi@[Enter Your IP Address]:share/${workspaceFolderBasename}/'"
```

Replace the ```[Enter Your IP Address]``` Section with the IP Address of your Pi (No Square Brackets!).

You will also need to change the username (```pi@```) and password (```-p \"raspberry"```) if you have altered those too.

# Debugging from VS Code on Windows

If you want to Debug from VSCode on a Windows PC, then modify the ```.NET Core Launch Console``` task in the ```.vscode/launch.json``` files in the various projects to point to your Pi's Hostname;

```
"pipeArgs": [
    "-pw",
    "raspberry",
    "root@[Your Pi Hostname].local"
],
```

You'll also need to install the VS Debugger;

```
curl -sSL https://aka.ms/getvsdbgsh | bash /dev/stdin -r linux-arm -v latest -l ~/vsdbg
```

You may also need to install curl and zip if they're not already installed;

```
sudo apt-get install curl
```
